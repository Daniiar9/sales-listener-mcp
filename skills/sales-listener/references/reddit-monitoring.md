# Reddit Monitoring

How to use Reddit for sales intelligence.

---

## Why Reddit

- Anonymous users = brutally honest opinions
- Real discussions, not marketing fluff
- People ask for recommendations (trigger events)
- Complaints about competitors = your opportunities

---

## Define Your Own Subreddits

The default subreddits below are starting points. Every ICP is different.

### How to Set Up Your Monitoring List

Tell the AI what you sell and who you sell to:
```
I sell [PRODUCT TYPE] to [JOB TITLES] at [COMPANY TYPE].

Help me find the best subreddits to monitor for:
1. Where my ICP hangs out
2. Where they discuss problems I solve
3. Where they ask for recommendations
4. Where they complain about competitors
```

### Example
```
I sell expense management software to CFOs and Controllers at mid-market companies (100-1000 employees).

Help me find the best subreddits to monitor for:
1. Where my ICP hangs out
2. Where they discuss finance/accounting problems
3. Where they ask for software recommendations
4. Where they complain about Expensify, Brex, Ramp
```

### Your Custom Monitoring List

Create your own list:
```
MY SUBREDDITS TO MONITOR:

Primary (check daily):
- r/[subreddit1] - [why]
- r/[subreddit2] - [why]
- r/[subreddit3] - [why]

Secondary (check weekly):
- r/[subreddit4] - [why]
- r/[subreddit5] - [why]

Competitors mentioned most in:
- r/[subreddit] - [competitor A, competitor B]
```
