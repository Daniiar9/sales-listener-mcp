## Why RSS

- Press releases reveal strategy
- New features = new objections to prepare for
- Hiring pages show where they're investing

## Pro Tips

1. **Don't oversubscribe** - 20-30 quality feeds beats 200 noisy ones
2. **Use folders** - Organize by priority
3. **Star, don't read** - Scan headlines, deep-read later
4. **Share with team** - Forward relevant items to Slack/email
5. **Act on intel** - News is useless if you don't use it
6. **Prune regularly** - Unsubscribe from feeds you never read
