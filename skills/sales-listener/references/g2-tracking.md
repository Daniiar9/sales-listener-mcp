| "Switched from" | Who they're beating |
| "Switched to" | Who's beating them |

## Finding Competitor Reviews

### Direct Links

Go to: `g2.com/products/[competitor-name]/reviews`

Or search: `site:g2.com "[competitor name]" reviews`

### Comparison Pages

These are gold - see how buyers compare:

`g2.com/compare/[competitor-a]-vs-[competitor-b]`

## Review Analysis Framework

When reading reviews, extract:

### 1. Pain Points (Negative Reviews)

Look for patterns in 1-3 star reviews:
```
What specific features are missing?
What's frustrating about the UX?
How's their support?
Any pricing complaints?
Implementation issues?
```

### 2. Strengths (Positive Reviews)

Know what you're up against:
```
What do people love?
What made them choose this vendor?
What would they miss if they left?
```

### 3. Switching Signals

Search within reviews for:
```
"switched from"
"moved from"
"replaced"
"looking for alternative"
"considering switching"
```

### 4. Buyer Context

Note who's reviewing:
```
Company size (SMB, mid-market, enterprise)
Industry
Role/title
How long they've used it
```

4. Update your competitor intel sheet
5. Share new findings with team

### Before Competitive Deals

## Turning Reviews Into Sales Ammo

### Complaint to Question

| Complaint | Landmine Question |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Support is slow" | "How important is response time when you have an issue?" |
| "Hard to customize" | "How much do you need to tailor this to your workflow?" |
| "Expensive for what you get" | "What's your expected ROI timeline?" |
| "Steep learning curve" | "How quickly does your team need to be up and running?" |
| "Missing X feature" | "How critical is X to your process?" |

### Quote in Sales Conversations

Use carefully - don't be slimy:

**Good:** "I've heard some [Competitor] customers mention [issue]. Is that something you've experienced?"

**Bad:** "G2 says [Competitor] sucks because..."

## Pro Tips

1. **Read 1-star AND 5-star reviews** - Know both sides
2. **Check review dates** - Old complaints may be fixed
3. **Note company size** - Enterprise complaints may not apply to SMB
4. **Look for patterns** - One complaint is noise, five is signal
5. **Update regularly** - Reviews change, stay current
6. **Verify claims** - Sometimes reviews are planted or outdated
