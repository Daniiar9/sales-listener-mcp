# Sales Listener

Social listening plugin that helps sales teams monitor what competitors are doing and what your ICP is talking about.

## Why This Matters

Your buyers are talking right now:
- Complaining about your competitor on Reddit
- Asking for recommendations on Hacker News
- Leaving reviews on G2
- Discussing problems you solve

If you're not listening, your competitors are.
